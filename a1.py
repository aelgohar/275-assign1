def least_cost_path(graph, start, dest, cost):
    """
    Find and return a least cost path in graph from start vertex to dest vertex.
    Efficiency: If E is the number of edges, the run-time is
      O( E log(E) ).
    Args:
      graph (Graph): The digraph defining the edges between the
        vertices.
      start: The vertex where the path starts. It is assumed
        that start is a vertex of graph.
      dest:  The vertex where the path ends. It is assumed
        that dest is a vertex of graph.
      cost:  A class with a method called "distance" that takes
        as input an edge (a pair of vertices) and returns the cost
        of the edge. For more details, see the CostDistance class
        description below.
    Returns:
      list: A potentially empty list (if no path can be found) of
        the vertices in the graph. If there was a path, the first
        vertex is always start, the last is always dest in the list.
        Any two consecutive vertices correspond to some
        edge in graph.

def load_edmonton_graph(filename):
    """
    Loads the graph of Edmonton from the given file.
    Returns two items
      graph: the instance of the class Graph() corresponding to the
        directed graph from edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt
      location: a dictionary mapping the identifier of a vertex to
        the pair (lat, lon) of geographic coordinates for that vertex.
        These should be integers measuring the lat/lon in 100000-ths
        of a degree.
    In particular, the return statement in your code should be
      return graph, location
    (or whatever name you use for the variables).
    Note: the vertex identifiers should be converted to integers
      before being added to the graph and the dictionary.
